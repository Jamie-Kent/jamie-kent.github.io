[YouTube: 2022 Complete Unifi Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGBFkIzf6x0)

This would have been more useful as a guide after all kit arrives. Not worth watching the reasearch stage

[YouTube: Is Ubiquiti UniFi Worth It? \| New Network Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwc9GgFs_gE)

I like Peter but he has no idea what he is doing with network stuff. He was sent loads of kit so not a good reference point

[YouTube: Which is the Best AP for You? - UniFi Access Points Explained 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5I_WhnviYY)

Essentially the U6 Lite should be fine for home. Anything else is kinda overkill by the sounds of it. Mileage may vary depending on your house size

[Stackoverflow: How to use escaped pipe in markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17319940/how-to-escape-a-pipe-char-in-a-code-statement-in-a-markdown-table)

You can escape a pipe in markdown using a backslash

[YouTube: Unifi Protect G5 bullet review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbmrdY2lA5k)

The g4 bullet is better than G5 as it's higher res / looks better at night. There is a comparison on the video
<br><br>

**Chat with GPT** <br>
I then wondered how much storage will be needed to store 1 months worth of footage for 2x G4 cameras which are recording in 2k for a month straight. I asked GPT this and the following is a link to the chat. [link to ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/b955b46b-bae4-4b3d-984e-a2b84a373c51)

**Summary of chat** <br>
1GB of storage per day so ~30GB per month. This is not very much if you're planning on deleting the footage when not needed. Using a dream machine would be overkill for this if you're not requiring other features it offers.

[Reddit: Do I need a Unifi gateway?](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNIFI/comments/15rgxt3/do_i_need_a_unifi_gateway/)

Essentially the gateway is for pretty dashboard / for inbuilt storage. Not sure there is much other reason to use it. Someone suggested usign a RaspberryPi as a cloud key using something called [UnifiPi](https://unifipi.com/)

Further research needed here
