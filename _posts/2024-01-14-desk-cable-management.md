## Overview

This is going to be an article about the before and after of how my cabling looks at my desk. I'm going to research the best method for cable management as recently my company moved office and seeing how they had managed their cables inspired me to fix my setup up.

My desk is currently being used for me and my brother as we're currently working from home. As of tomorrow we're going to be working in the office again so I can now think about properly managing my desk to neaten up the cables.

[TUTORIAL: Ultimate Cable Management Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeskCableManagement/comments/fn3xi9/tutorial_ultimate_cable_management_guide/)

In this article the person posts a couple of pictures of setups which only have a single cable running from the desk to the power outlets in the wall. Both are very minimalist and this is exactly what I'm going ==for==.

## Cable managment summary

I initially thought cable management was hard and that I was doing something wrong. I've realised that by mounting the power strip to the bottom of the desk it frees up the whole rack for cables. By using velcro strips then wrapping all cables, they can be bundled in the [IKEA signum](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/signum-cable-trunking-horizontal-silver-colour-30200253/) rack which I already had - there is no need to purchase a J channel like suggested on the reddit guide above.

### Mounting desktop to desk

I'd like to mount my desktop to the bottom of the desk. From researching online these are referred to as CPU holders.

My case has a stated width of 230mm when checking [Overclockers UK](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/phanteks-enthoo-evolv-micro-atx-glass-case-gunmetal-grey-ca-06n-pt.html?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAqY6tBhAtEiwAHeRopYIrAoDr0KyPU9axVji92Hu4WzV9enFADbmVVnihvkSc_5kdibNCWhoCANUQAvD_BwE). This is bigger than usual cases which means that there are not many options. One of few options is the [Secretlab Premium PC Mount](https://secretlab.co.uk/products/premium-pc-mount) which is for their Magnus Pro standing desk. When asking live chat they said that the mount will not work on other desks.

### Custom desktop holder

I found a [reddit post](ttps://www.reddit.com/r/StandingDesk/comments/15v02tt/does_anyone_do_a_sitstand_desk_with_their_desktop/) from someone who has created their own mount using angled metal strips from home depot.
