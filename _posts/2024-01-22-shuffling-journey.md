## Overview

I have some friend who shuffle and it's always something I'd like to be good at. I've never actually put any time into learning how.

There is a trip planned for March, this gives me a motive to work towards. Some videos have been sent through and I've found some tutorials on YouTube so I'll be putting some time into the learning and then will post my progress here.
